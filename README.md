# Raspberry Pi + Ansible + Docker

I want to learn how to manage my raspberry pi's with ansible.

This is in preparation of my raspberry pi cluster project.

## Initial Outcomes

As a prereq to managing a cluster of Pis, I want to learn how to manage one Pi to run docker containers.

Use ansible to setup the Pi.

How do I deploy containers to the Pi tho? Can ansible do that?

## Starting point

So what is ansible, and how can I manage one Pi with it?

I'm on mac os, and my Raspberry Pi 4 B is running headless rasp os.

How do I get started with ansible?
